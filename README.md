# ZURB TwentyTwenty

Need to highlight the differences between two images? [TwentyTwenty](http://zurb.com/playground/twentytwenty), a visual diff tool, makes it easy to spot them!

This module provides a field formatter for Image fields to display them for [TwentyTwenty](http://zurb.com/playground/twentytwenty) comparison. The Image field must have two images to work properly, as it is showing a comparison of two images. Setting the number of values to 2 is required before the field will render properly.
